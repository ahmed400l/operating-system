<h2>importance of operating system</h2>

An operating system brings powerful benefits to computer software and software development. Without an operating system, every application would need to
include its own UI, as well as the comprehensive code needed to handle all low-level functionality of the underlying computer, such as disk storage,
 network interfaces and so on. Considering the vast array of underlying hardware available, this would vastly bloat the size of every application and make 
 software development impractical.Instead, many common tasks, such as sending a network packet or displaying text on a standard output device,
 such as a display, can be offloaded to system software that serves as an intermediary between the applications and the hardware. The system software provides
 a consistent and  repeatable way for applications to interact with the hardware without the applications needing to know any details about the hardware.
